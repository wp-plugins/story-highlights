== Description ==

Like the "Story Highlights" lists on articles at CNN.com and other sites, this adds a bullet list to each post's content via an edit post page panel. The plugin sets up the code only, styling can be handled by adding the classes provided under the Other Notes to style.css in your theme.

== Use ==

Add a new post or edit an existing post. A new panel titled "Story Highlights" appears in the right column of the edit post page. If these fields are all blank, the plugin does nothing. To add a "Story Highlights" bullet list to your post, you MUST add a list title and the first bullet point. Otherwise an empty list appears. You may add up to five bullet points, summarizing your post. To delete a bullet point, clear the field. UPDATE your post to save your bullet points.

== Styling ==

This plugin inserts a (mostly) unstyled element above your post content. The following unique classes can be added to your stylesheet and used to position and style the element, allowing the freedom to style each element individually:
<pre>
<code>
div.shsp
h1.shsp_title
ul#shsp_ul
li.shsp_li1
li.shsp_li2
li.shsp_li3
li.shsp_li4
li.shsp_li5
</code>
</pre>

== Alignment ==

Below the list fields is the option "choose alignment". By default it is set to "none" which inserts the element as a block above the post. Leave this option if you wish to manually apply your own floats to the element. Otherwise choose "left" or "right" to float the element to the right or the left of the first paragraph of your post. Note that floating the list left or right may break your layout if you insert an image at the start of your post.

== Widget ==

This plugin adds the Story Highlights widget to the Appearance > Widgets page. Add this widget to the sidebar that will be displayed on single post pages. This widget has no settings. If the widget is active then the post element is not inserted, and the list appears in the sidebar. Remove the widget from the sidebar if you wish to display the element within the post body.
